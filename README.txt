#### README for NY Doppler Radar Viewer aka Weather_App_NY_2.py ####
# Code included was generated by MS Copilot and refined in different parts to combine them together to create this small application.  
 Retrieve latest precipatation forecast gif from the national weather service website https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/standard/NORTHEAST_loop.gif
 and display it in a local window on the computer. 
This application uses the packages listed in requirements.txt for which you should update the venv in program repository with program.
This is an early version of a PyQt5 desktop app currently limited to Northeast and without extenuating controls or queries of weather data. A starting point
# Currently the program;
- Loads the most recent radar loop at runtime
- Uses PyQt5 for a clean GUI
- Automatically scales the radar image
- No local files required — everything runs from memory

Future Plans
- Add timestamp overlay
- Refresh button for manual updates
- Support for other regions

### To get started you must have the following;
1. Required systems
- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5
- `requests` library

2. Download the raw zip file and place in a location accessible to your preferred python installation.

3. Build the virtual environment from requirements.txt in the /Weather_App_NY_1/.venv directory using
    python.exe -m venv .venv 

4. Install requirements using 
    python.exe -r requirements.txt

5. If installing from requirements.txt does not work, you can manually install to your python installation either on your system or virtual environment
    pip install PyQt5 requests

6. To run the application, run the following in a bash terminal with your system or virtual enviornment python
    python.exe Weather_App_NY_2.py
